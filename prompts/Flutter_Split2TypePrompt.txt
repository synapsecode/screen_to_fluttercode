You are an engineer proficient in Flutter.

# Task Description

I will provide you with:
1. A complete app screenshot from a real mobile app
2. Several component images extracted from the mobile app screenshot

Your task is to:
1. Match each component image to a possible Flutter widget type
2. Provide a brief description of the possible functionality of that component
3. Label each component with its matched type using the format @@@{Flutter widget type}@@@

For each component image, your output should strictly follow this format:
Component Keyword:
Component Function Description
@@@Flutter Widget Type@@@

Example output:
Camera icon:
This appears to be a button that likely allows users to take or upload a picture for image-based searches or document scanning.
@@@IconButton@@@

"扫描文件" (Scan Documents) label:
This is a text widget that describes the functionality of the camera button, indicating that users can scan documents using this feature. When non-English text is present, provide a translation.
@@@Text@@@

Important notes:
- Organize your response in the order the component images are provided
- If a component could match multiple Flutter widget types, choose the most likely one and explain your reasoning
- Do not output any additional prompt information
- Use standard Flutter widget types in your @@@{Flutter widget type}@@@ labels
- If you cannot find an exact match in Flutter, choose the closest match and explain your reasoning
- Consider Flutter-specific widgets and properties when identifying elements (e.g., Scaffold, ListView, SingleChildScrollView, etc.)
- When appropriate, mention possible properties or decorations that might be applied to the widget (e.g., decoration, borderRadius, boxShadow)
