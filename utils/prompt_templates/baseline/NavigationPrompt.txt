Please create a React Navigation configuration file named App.js for a React Native application. 
The <Stack.Screen> component's name attribute should correspond to the id of the Page Node ({page_list}), and the respective screen component JavaScript code should be located in the "./components" folder.In the navigation configuration file App.js, the page route name needs to match the page name.
You should import the Screen code like this: `import ExampleScreen from './components/ExampleScreen';` You need to replace "Example" with the `node_id` from `{page_list}`. Use 'Screen' instead of 'Page'.
Note that a navigator can only contain 'Screen', 'Group' or 'React.Fragment' as its direct children. To render this component in the navigator, pass it in the 'component' prop to 'Screen'.
Your response should only contain code, without any additional prompt information, and do not use code block markup.
